## Program goals

The movement of a charge in a static electromagnetic field is a perfect example of various types of microscopic phenomena on the based on the **basic laws such as Coulomb's Law or the Biot-Savart Law**. The physical phenomena presented in the following thesis corresponds to the classical definition of electrodynamics and boil down to the analysis of the behaviour of physical bodies with a defined electric charge. Unfortunately, an analytical solution to this type of relation in general, is not possible. Therefore, the project uses a finite difference method.

## Solution method

The problem concerns an electric charge moving in the static field generated by other charges and conductors with current. The issue is reduced to two dimensional space. The main part of this simulation is based on **central finite difference technique** (or Euler method is also implemented). Starting from Lorentz force and the second Newton's law (for two dimensional case) the charge position is determined by a set of differential equations.

## Application as a game

When having the necessary computational tools, the implementation a graphical interface was created in which the user, knowing the laws of physics, tries to determine the path of the moving charge in the field from other charges and conductors with current. In this purpose, he plays through various levels of difficulty (often by trial and error), containing with more complicated configuration of charges and conductors. **This idea can be briefly described by the following sequence of operations:**

- The user chooses a difficulty level (number of charges and conductors).
- A random configuration of charges and/or conductors is generated and the trajectory of the considered charge is determined (the configuration and the trajectory are invisible to the user).
- On the base of the calculated trajectory the allowed path of the charge is estimated and shown to the user (the allowed path is obtain by extension of the trajectory to a specified thickness). Also a new random configuration of the sources is generated.
- The user has to reconstruct the configuration of the charges and/or conductors in order to obtain the movement inside the allowed path.
- After the reconstruction try, the user starts the simulation of the charge movement to check its correctness.
- If the reconstructed configuration is correct the charge moves inside the path and the level is completed. Otherwise the configuration can be modified again and the simulation can be repeated until the charge trajectory is acceptable.

## Additional comments

The application of a purely educational and theoretical character is to be a scientific aid for first-year students of Electronics and Telecommunications (or related fields), as well as for all people who are trying to understand the basics of physics, necessary for later studying issues related to electromagnetism. In this way, studies of the theory is more enjoyable and addictive, resulting in better learning effect.
